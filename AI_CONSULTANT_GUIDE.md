## 📊 Example Conversations

### Strategy Session
```
You: "I run a SaaS company with 1000 users and $50K MRR. 
      How can I reach $100K MRR in 6 months?"

AI: [Deep Reasoning Mode Activated]

💭 Reasoning Process:
- Current state: $50K MRR, 1000 users = $50 ARPU
- Target: $100K MRR (100% growth in 6 months)
- Options: Increase users, increase ARPU, or both
- Evaluating feasibility and risk...

**Strategic Recommendation:**

**Option 1: Hybrid Growth (Recommended)**
- Increase users by 50% (1000 → 1500)
- Increase ARPU by 33% ($50 → $67)
- Result: 1500 × $67 = $100K MRR

**Action Plan:**
1. Month 1-2: Implement pricing tier optimization
   - Add premium tier at $99/mo
   - Upsell 20% of users
   
2. Month 2-4: Scale acquisition
